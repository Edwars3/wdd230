            <p>The Wipro Website present the principle of Hierarchy because it is stuctured from the most important
                for the company that is the mission and going to other points as to show the purpose but also how they
                work

            <p>This site is a good example of contrast, when the Accesibility Validation was done has 0 errors of
                contrast, the selection of colors are alligned
                with the image of the company,but also are legible

            <p>The white space is well used here, there are not many content that could distract the visitors of the
                site
                the design is simple and allow to find information easier,no many text in home page even when the site
                has
                a lot of content
